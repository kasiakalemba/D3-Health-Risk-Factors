        <h3>% of Population Without Healthcare</h3>
         <h4>vs. Income</h4>
         <p>The percentage of people not covered by insurance appears to have a downward trend as income increases. This trend is to somewhat be expected as individuals earning higher salaries typically are covered by their employers insurance plan</p>
         <h4>vs. Age</h4>
         <p>This was a quite interesting trend to see. The most uninsured cluster between age 35 to about 40. It could be that the survey was mostly collected for that group as well.</p>
         <h4>vs. Poverty</h4>
         <p>This graph shows the poverty percentage of each state as well as percantage without healthcare. There is a slight trend showing that the states that have higher poverty also have a higher percentage of people uninsured. This is quite expected as the first analysis showed a downward trend with increasing income.</p>
