        <h2>Health Risk Factor Analysis</h2>
        <h3>% of Population Without Healthcare</h3>
        <h4>vs. Income</h4>
        <p>The percentage of people not covered by insurance appears to have a downward trend as income increases. This
          trend is to somewhat be expected as individuals earning higher salaries typically are covered by their
          employers insurance plan</p>
        <h4>vs. Age</h4>
        <p>This was a quite interesting trend to see. The most uninsured cluster between age 35 to about 40. It could be
          that the survey was mostly collected for that group as well.</p>
        <h4>vs. Poverty</h4>
        <p>This graph shows the poverty percentage of each state as well as percantage without healthcare. There is a
          slight trend showing that the states that have higher poverty also have a higher percentage of people
          uninsured. This is quite expected as the first analysis showed a downward trend with increasing income.</p>

        <h3>% of Population Smoking</h3>
        <h4>vs. Income</h4>
        <p>Smoking tends to decrease in states which have a higher mean income. States with the highest population that
          smokes cluster in the south and these states also neighbor each other. This could have a possible connection
          to the lifestyle trends there.</p>
        <h4>vs. Age</h4>
        <p>Middle age populations tend to cluster the most when it comes to smoking. We saw a similar trend in the
          healthcare vs. income too so it would be interesting to see the age of the surveyed people for these factors.
        </p>
        <h4>vs. Poverty</h4>
        <p>There is a very slight correlation between smoking and poverty but the overall levels tends to be steady
          across all states.</p>

        <h3>% of Obesity</h3>
        <h4>vs. Income</h4>
        <p>Obesity tends to decrease as income increases. This is quite expected as people with higher incomes usually
          have resources to healthier eating options. In areas without fresh produce, fast food chains dominate a lot of
          people's diets.</p>
        <h4>vs. Age</h4>
        <p>Obesity seems to cluster in the middle age category yet this trends seen for the third time makes me
          suspicious of the data collected from a certain population within that age group. It would be interesting to
          look at the age of the surveyed people.</p>
        <h4>vs. Poverty</h4>
        <p>This shows the opposite trend of the income graph which is expected. As poverty increases, there is a slight
          increase in % of population which is obese.</p>
