## Skills Displayed: 
* Understanding of SVG elements and how to append/modify them using D3
* Understanding how to bind data to SVG elements using D3 so as to create basic bar charts from scratch
* Creating different charts with axes using D3 so as to visualize data
* Plotting multiple columns from a dataset, either simultaneously or in alternation

## D3 Dabbler
* Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age
* Using the D3 techniques created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements
* Placed additional labels in the scatter plot and gave them click events so that your users can decide which data to display
* Animated the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes
* Added tooltips to circles and displayed each tooltip with the data that the user has selected
* Used python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser
