# Health Risk Factors

## Summary: 
I analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings using D3. The factors looked at are poverty, age, or household income in relation to to obesity, smoking, and lack of healthcare. 

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml

## Technologies
* Javascript: D3
* HTML, Boostrap, CSS

## Development
* Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age
* Using the D3 techniques created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements
* Placed additional labels in the scatter plot and gave them click events so that your users can decide which data to display
* Animated the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes
* Added tooltips to circles and displayed each tooltip with the data that the user has selected
* Used python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at local host in your web browser
